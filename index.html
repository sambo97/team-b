      <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>This is a console-based application that will serve as a course registration system. You can imagine that the system
 will be used by a local college to register students for courses and also for students to self-register.</p>

<p><strong>Screens</strong></p>

<p>A login screen</p>

<p>A screen that shows the list of courses available and the ability to register for one</p>

<p>A registration status screen that denotes either success or failure upon registration</p>

<p>A student profile page that shows a list of classes that the student is already registered for</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong></p>

<p>The ability for students to view an alphabetical list of courses that includes the course identification number, course dates, name, brief summary, the enrollment limit, and the number of students already enrolled. </p>

<p>The ability for students to register or un-register for a course.</p>

<p>The ability for a student to see a list of classes for which he/she is currently registered. </p>

<p>The system does not allow a student to register for a course that has already reached its max enrollment limit.</p>

<p>The system does not allow one student to view the registration information for another student.</p>

<p>The system does not allow a student to un-register from a course for which he/she is not registered.</p>
